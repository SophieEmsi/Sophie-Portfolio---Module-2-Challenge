## Creation of a central portfolio to showcase my work to prospective employers.


- My motivation for this project is to create a portfolio of my work which prospective employers can view.
- I would like a central location to showcase my work so that when I apply for jobs my work can be easily viewed to support any job applications.
- Having a purpose built portfolio means that I can simplify job applications by directing people to this webpage.
- During this project I learnt how to incorporate CSS flex and CSS grid into my design. I also learnt how to use the anchor tag to hyperlink to different parts of the page.
